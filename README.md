Hello World Optional Class Exercise.
My name is Erica Walters. I am a student at Grand Canyon University and attending a class called computer programming 1 taught by Lisa Hebert. I will be on class closer to graduating at the conclusion of this class.
The changes here are to write the Hello World Program in GitHub.
